Shout-out to my main inspo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SchizoDev">SchizoDev</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@niceaicats7226">niceAiCats</a>, and also to the people who's repositories were the best at helping me to create this wonderful chatbot, <a href="https://github.com/AlizerUncaged">AliezerUncaged</a> ("AI Waifu Assistant") and <a href="https://github.com/ardha27">Ardha27</a> ("AI Waifu Vtuber").

For the documentation of the project, you'll find it here in my repo, it's written in Romanian but maybe in the future I'll make it in English as well. In short, the concept of this app is to talk with the one and only Hatsune Miku (you can change her identity by the way) and she will speak to you only in Japanese (because this is the scope of the project) through VoiceVox TTS Engine (check out Hiroshiba's repo on GitHub), or in other languages but that would ruin the fun (for me at least :>) and then you''' receive an answer from her in Japanese and English as well. 

If you want to make it work as well, you need to find your OpenAI API Key on the official website (https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), put it in the `.env` file I provided and then to run the file `aiGF.bat` on your local machine and follow the instructions I gave you there. You need to install Docker so you can run VoiceVox through it, VTube Studio from Steam (it's a free up) and there you can choose your avatar or search on Google for a Live2D model, and OBS (for visual with subtitles) (every single detail it's explained in the documentation I provideed in this repo, you just need to translate it to English if you don't understand Romanian, until I'll put an EN version as well). And also, in `app.py`, put in the "master" variable your name so she can know with who's talking^^

So have fun with my app and enjoy your conversation with Hatsune! ^^

P.S. : This was actually a project for my Multimedia Application course which, by the way, received a full grade :>
